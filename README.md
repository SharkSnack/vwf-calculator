# Variable Width Font Calculator

A small app that calculates line widths for games that use variable width fonts.

Link: https://sharksnack.github.io/vwf-calculator/

## Width Definition

Widths are defined as a JSON file in src/json.

## Preview Feature

Currently only implemented for Shiren 4+ (PSP version).

If you want to use it for a game you're working on, simply create a game folder with in-game font glyphs, with each letter being named as [char code].png. (UTF)

See the shiren4 folder in public for an example.
